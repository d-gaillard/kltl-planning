# Motion Planning using Linear Temporal Logic with the "Knowledge" Operator

A continuation of the work detailed in the **kltl0** repository (https://github.com/kwesiRutledge/kltl0.git) by Dylan Gaillard and Kwesi Rutledge, partially built using the framework of STLPlanning (https://github.com/sundw2014/STLPlanning).

This repository demonstrates KLTL as a tool for motion planning in continuous state spaces.
